            <div class="paragraph">
                Groups can have a maximum of five members. Perhaps you already have a complete group. Perhaps you have a partial group but are missing certain expertise. Or perhaps you are a solo developer looking for a group.
                <br /> <br />
                Use the Padlet <a href="https://padlet.com/ash0360/hackathon-groupings-board-zn7gdg06p0747gmu">here</a> to find group members.
                <br /> <br />
                Once you have a group, register your group with a team name <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=UPs_KAujjEiQ9M2uT3rm0dZxp8wMLoFGlTXKSPBITSRUNldPWDQwT0VOR1hUWUJMRklXUVpDVFEyMS4u">here</a>

                With your group finalised, you next need to figure out what you want to build.
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your group?</li>
                    <li>What is achievable in the timeframe?</li>
                    <li>What would your product be?</li>
                    <li>What is your unique selling point?</li>
                    <li>Who would your target market be?</li>
                    <li>How would you monetise your product?</li>

                Nothing to say here, just build your product. Make use of the expertise in the room and the workshops available. Also check the schedule for other activities - Ash intends to destroy you all in the MarioKart tournament.
